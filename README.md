# Work
I'm a coder who enjoys developing useful applications like expense trackers and BMI calculators, as well as entertaining games like Hangman and Rock Paper Scissors. I also enjoy creating user-friendly interfaces for projects like dice rollers and password-guessing games. My goal is to create software that is both efficient and fun for users.
